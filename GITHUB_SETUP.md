# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Configure Git (First Time Only)

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

```

## Step 2: Create Initial Commit

```bash
cd "c:\Coding Projects\Audacity-CloudAI"
git add .
git commit -m "Initial release: Full-featured Audacity Cloud AI plugin"
```

## Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:

   - **Visibility:** Public
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 4: Connect and Push

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd "c:\Coding Projects\Audacity-CloudAI"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cloud-audio-ai-audacity-addon.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**
